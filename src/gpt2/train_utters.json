Maybe his friend works in an electronics store. They sell video cameras there. Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.

    "I didn't do anything. Finally, He left. But then I saw him again today. Outside the shoe store. Near the cafe. I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's. But then he came in too.",
    "Did he leave when you left?",
    "Yes. Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me. He was following me.",
    "What did you do?",
    "He followed me all the way home!",
    "That's about five blocks. And around corners too. So he was definitely following you.",
    "Yes, He was. I'm not imagining it. Finally, Just when I got home, I turned around and looked at him. He was just standing there. He didn't smile. He just stood there. It was so obvious. What should I do? I'm so scared. Can I call the police?",
    "Actually, I don't think you can call the police. Not yet at least. He hasn't done anything. And probably the police will just ignore it. But if anything happens again, Then maybe you should call.",

    "Listen, Carol. Don't let this bother you too much. Probably it's nothing. Just keep your eyes open when you go out. If you see him a third time, And if he follows you again, Then I think we should go to the police. But for now, Just try not to worry.",

    "HanMaimed, What's your plan for the weekend?",

    "I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays.",
    "Oh, My God! John, I didn't know you are religious. You just look like a scientific kook, Like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory.",
    "Come on, HanMaimed, Don't make a fuss. A lot of Americans, Including many scientists, Believe in religion.",
    "But I'm really surprised. I thought science and religion are not compatible, Are they?",
    "Yes, They are compatible. Actually, The U.S. Is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world.",
    "I've heard about it a little bit before, But I don't understand. How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist?",
    "That's a little complicated. You'll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U.S. History later on. Religion was and is a part of American people's life. Guess what? Even Harvard University, Which is a highly academic institution, Is in a sense the product of religion.",
    "Really?",
    "Absolutely! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England.",
    "Why was it founded by the Puritans? Where were the atheistic educators?",
    "Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans.",
    "How come? I mean why most of them were religious people?",
    "That's because in the 16th and 17th century, There was a series of religious reforms in England. Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries.",
    "So, You mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England?",
    "Yes, That's why Puritans moved to the New World, Where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans. Later on, It was these Puritans who founded Harvard College.",
    "Why did they want to found a college?",
    "Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England. They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well.",
    "Oh, I see.",
    "Actually Harvard was first named 'New College', Without a formal name.",
    "When did it begin to be called Harvard University?",
    "In 1639, It was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard. Interestingly, JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman.",
    "It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion.",
    "Therefore, It's not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion, There would note Harvard.",

    "Diana, In your opinion, Which is more important, Iq or EQ?",
    "Why are you asking me the strange question, Jerry?",
    "I watched the movie Forrest Gump last night. And the question just lined in my mind.",
    "Well. I think IQ matters more. But it won't work without EQ.",
    "Why? You seem pretty sure about it.",
    "Because an intellectual mind can only be a beneficial thing in life.",
    "But IQ is decided at birth. One can't expect to make a lot of improvement in it.",
    "That's why people's achievement varies greatly.",
    "That's true, But what if one comes across some difficulties. He must rely on his EQ to deal with them.",
    "Yes, Jerry, Can you share your understanding of EQ?",
    "I think it is independent of IQ and plays a prominent role in deciding the way we live our lives.",
    "Quite right. Have you noticed that a high IQ is not a must for one's success?",
    "Just as Forrest?",
    "Yes, His IQ is high enough for him to embrace the success as long as he can manage his EQ.",
    "I got it."

    "How do you find studying a language on the internet?",
    "It's not easy, Particularly with listening and speaking, Because sometimes the connection isn't too good.",
    "I bet you find the character difficult to write!",
    "Actually, Many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese, So they're easy for me.",
    "So, You can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers, Right?",
    "Yes. How are the Spanish classes going?",
    "In a way, It's similar to your experience of learning Chinese. Some Spanish words are very similar to English ones. But I need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself."
